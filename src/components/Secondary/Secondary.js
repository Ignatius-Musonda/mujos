                    <p>Mujos Secondary School was founded in 1988 with a strong Christian ethos which remains today the foundation of all that takes place at the school</p>

                    <p>The formation of a childâ€™s character is valued highly and the school deliberately creates opportunities for this alongside its student leadership programmes. The school benefits from a superb campus with excellent facilities which as well as the high standards of teaching and pastoral care provide an ideal environment for students to learn.</p>
